# HDC1080Sensor-StepperMotor-LEDs-RTOS-CS452
This program is written for the Raspberry Pi Pico Feather, Vandaluino3 PCB, and HDC 1080 Temperature Sensor. 
Running in the FreeRTOS OS, Temperature and Humidity values are read from the HDC 1080 Temperature / Humidity sensor and displayed on the 7-segment LED's on the board.
There is also control for a Stepper Motor through push buttons soldered onto the Vandaluino3 PCB.

This program builds on the Stepper Motor Driver. Adding support for 4 LEDs soldered onto the Vandaluino3 PCB.  

Created while attending CS452 at the University of Idaho.
